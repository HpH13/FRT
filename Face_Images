When downloading this entire Repository 
Please delete the Face_Image one and create a normal folder, called Face_Images.
Within that folder add pictures of the people you want the system to recognise within their own folders. 
For example 
If you want to recognise 'Steven Gerrard'. Create folder called 'Steven Gerrard' within the Face_Images folder you have just created.
Then add pictures into this folder.
